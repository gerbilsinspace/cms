# CMS

> A Simple CMS using Vue

In order to use this CMS, you'll need a few things.

* A [Firebase Account](https://firebase.google.com) with a new firebase project. Firebase is a database service from Google. We will use this to provide storage for our website information, and authentication. 
* Access to your Firebase's Google Cloud service so you can allow your images to be hosted publicly. Don't worry, we will go through how to do this.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
